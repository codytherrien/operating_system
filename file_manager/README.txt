How to use disk files
Step 1: execute "make" in terminal to compile diskinfo, disklist, diskget, and diskput
Step 2: execute any of the following:
    "./diskinfo <disk anme>"
    "./disklist <disk name>"
    "./diskget <disk name> <file name>"
    "./diskput <disk name> <directory/filename name>"

diskinfo -> prints the information about the disk
disklist -> prints the informations about the directories and files on the disk
diskget -> copies a file from the root directory of the disk to the local directory
diskput -> copies a file from the local directory to any directory on the disk
